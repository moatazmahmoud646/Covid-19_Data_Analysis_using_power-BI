# COVID-19 Global Data Analysis | Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends using day-to-day country-wise data.  
The goal is to explore confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases over time and present insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The analysis focuses on:
- Time-series trends of COVID-19 cases
- Country-wise comparison of confirmed, deaths, and recovery rates
- Identification of highly impacted regions
